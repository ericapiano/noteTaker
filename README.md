# Note Taker
In this activity I built a Node, Express, and MySQL powered note-taking application. The user will have the ability to create, read, and delete notes from a MySQL database.

## Getting Started
* Clone repo
* Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

## Instructions
* From the command line, cd into repo "noteTaker"
* From the command line, run: heroku open
* The homepage of the website has the title of the website. User will click the 'start' button to be brought to the "notes" page
* At the notes page, the user will receive a form to fill out the "title" and "content" of their note. The user can hit the 'save' button, which will add the note to the bottom of the list of already submitted notes
* Each note added will gain a 'delete' button, which provides the user the ability to delete a note.
